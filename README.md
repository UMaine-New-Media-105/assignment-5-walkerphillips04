Question 1 https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/CMkOIZfT-. For this first part I wanted to make my simulation a space one so instead of bubbles I made them squares for asteriods.  because asteroids move I coded them to bounce around the screen. But I did use move, update and, show constructors. 

Question 2 https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/jlRLwKu0_. For this part I added a handful more asteroids. I added 60 asteriods. I double checked and for somereason this link only works if you copy and paste it into the url because it is not picking up the underscore. 

Question 3 https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/ZExgq_qRn. For this part I created two different spirtes to populate the asteriod field. a breeder and a catcher. the catcher is a spaceship and the breeders are red space rocks. Then I set them up by having them move back and forth on the X axis

Question 4 https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/pgS4ZtPVT. For this part I edited the Breeder class so that when they collide with each other they blow up.


Question 5 https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/ZcQml5FGp. For this part I used the same method as I did for part 4 to make two catchers make a new one once they collide.
